**Project Idea: "Task-Based Project Management Tool"**

**Description:**
Create a task-based project management tool that helps users plan and track their projects, assign tasks, and collaborate with team members. This project provides an opportunity to learn various front-end and back-end frameworks while building a practical tool for project management and collaboration. Users should be able to register, create projects, assign tasks, and monitor progress.
